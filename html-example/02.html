<!--
    This example shows the basic structure of all HTML documents.

    HTML5 allows you to drop the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags if
    you want - but, I recommend you do not.
  -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <!--
      The <head> tag provides information about the document
      itself. It is a place where you can indicate what the window/tab
      of the document should be named, styling information, behavior
      (JavaScript), etc.

      The type of tags that exist inside the <head> tag provide
      document "meta-data" - tags that are used to describe the
      document itself.

      Here is an example of the title of the document:
    -->
  <title>A Simple HTML Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    The <body> tag provides the structure and content of the
    document. This is where the actual "view" of your web
    application's interface is defined.


    The main structural elements allow grouping of main document
    components. Here are a few of them:

    <body>, <section>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>, <h1> - <h6>
  -->

  <!-- <hgroup> can be used to group headers: -->
  <hgroup>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    <h2>October, 2014</h2>
  </hgroup>

  <!-- <nav> can be used to provide a navigation bar -->
  <nav>
    What I Did Yesterday <br>
    Swimming in Maine <br>
  </nav>

  <!-- An <article> is a self-contained document: -->
  <article>
    <!-- A <header> indicates a header: -->
    <header>
      <h2>What I Did Yesterday</h2>
      <!-- <time> can be used to indicate a time: -->
      <time>October 4, 2014</time>
    </header>
    <p>
      I did lots of things yesterday including...
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <header>
      <h2>Swimming in Maine</h2>
      <time>October 1, 2014</time>
    </header>
    <p>
      It was very cold, but I jumped in anyways...
    </p>

    <!-- An <aside> is used to define content aside the content it is
         placed in: -->
    <aside>
      <h4>Maine</h4>
      <p>A great place to go on vacation</p>
    </aside>
  </article>

  <!-- <address> is used to define addresses and contact information: -->
  <address>
    John Doe, 401 Klement Circle, Orange MA
  </address>

  <!-- The <footer> is used to define, well, a footer: -->
  <footer>
    My Awesome Blog
  </footer>

</body>
</html>
