<!doctype html>
<!--
    A simple example of an HTML file.

<!-- Every HTML document must have a "root" tag named HTML: -->
<html>
  <!--
  Most tags have a starting and ending tag. For example, here is a
  paragraph tag that has both a start and end:
  -->
  <p>
    <!--
    Content (character data) can be contained between a starting tag
    and ending tag as well as other tags.
    -->

    This is some text that <strong>I have included</strong> inside
    this paragraph tag.
  </p>

</html>
