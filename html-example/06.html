  <!-- It would be really nice if we could identify elements in a
       document. This will come in really handy when we talk about CSS
       and JavaScript. We can do this with the "id" attribute: -->
  <p id="para1">
    This is my first body of text:
    <div id="part1">
      This is some text.
    </div>

    <div id="part2">
      This is some more text.
    </div>
  </p>

  <!-- What if we want to classify a "set" of tags in a document?
       Perhaps we want all paragraphs to have a particular color or
       style. Perhaps we want to find all important words in a
       document. We use the "class" attribute to accomplish this: -->
  <p id="abstract" class="green-color">
    This is some <i class="red">text</i> that we want to use to
    describe <span class="important">the rest of the
    document</span>. But, we need to first <span class="crazy">write
    the rest of the document before midnight</span>!.
  </p>

  <!--
      Structuring data in tabular form is great!
    -->
